# Loops

A loop is a programming tool that repeats a set of instructions until a specified condition, called a stopping condition is reached. The generic term iterate when referring to loops; iterate simply means “to repeat”.

When we need to reuse a task in our code, we often bundle that action in a function. Similarly, when we see that a process has to repeat multiple times in a row, we write a loop. Loops allow us to create efficient code that automates processes to make scalable, manageable programs.
